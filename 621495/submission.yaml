comment: | 
 BNL-RHIC. We have measured transverse momentum distributions of charged hadrons produced in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\it NN}}} =$ 200 GeV. The spectra were obtained for transverse momenta $0.25 < p_T < 6.0$~GeV/c, in a pseudorapidity range of $0.2 < \eta < 1.4$ in the deuteron direction. The evolution of the spectra with collision centrality is presented in comparison to $p+\bar{p}$ collisions at the same collision energy.  With increasing centrality, the yield at high transverse momenta increases more rapidly than the overall particle density, leading to a strong modification of the spectral shape. This change in spectral shape is qualitatively different from observations in Au+Au collisions at the same energy. The results provide important information for discriminating between different models for the suppression of high-$p_T$ hadrons observed in Au+Au collisions.
