 BNL-RHIC. The centrality dependence of the midrapidity charged particle multiplicity in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 and 200 GeV is presented.  Within a simple model, the fraction of hard (scaling with number of binary collisions) to soft (scaling with number of participant pairs) interactions is consistent with a value of $x$ = 0.13$\pm$0.01(stat)$\pm$0.05(syst) at both energies. The experimental results at both energies, scaled by inelastic $p(\overline{p})+p$ collision data, agree within systematic errors. The ratio of the data was found not to depend on centrality over the studied range and yields a simple linear scale factor of R$_{200/19.6}$ = 2.03$\pm$0.02(stat)$\pm$0.05(syst).
