comment: |
 Forward-backward correlations of charged-particle multiplicities in symmetric bins in pseudorapidity are studied in order to gain insight into the underlying correlation structure of particle production in Au+Au collisions. The PHOBOS detector is used to measure integrated multiplicities in bins centered at $\eta$, defined within $|\eta|<3$, and covering intervals $\Delta \eta$.  The variance $\stc$ of a suitably defined forward-backward asymmetry variable $C$ is calculated as a function of $\eta$, $\Delta\eta$, and centrality.  It is found to be sensitive to short range correlations, and the concept of ``clustering'' is used to interpret comparisons to phenomenological models.
