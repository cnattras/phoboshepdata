comment: |
 We present results on charged particle production at very low transverse momenta in the 15% most central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} =$ 200~GeV obtained with the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. The invariant yields were measured at mid-rapidity in the transverse momentum ranges from 30 to 50 MeV/c for charged pions, 90 to 130 MeV/c for charged kaons and 140 to 210 MeV/c for protons and antiprotons. No significant enhancement in low transverse momentum particle production is observed as compared to extrapolations of identified particle spectra measured at an intermediate $p_T$ range. The spectra tend to flatten at low $p_T$, consistent with the expectations of transverse expansion of the system.
