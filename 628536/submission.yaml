  BNL-RHIC. The ratios of the yields of charged antiparticles to particles have been obtained for pions, kaons, and protons near mid-rapidity for d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 200$~GeV as a function of centrality. The reported values represent the ratio of the yields averaged over the rapidity range of $0.1<y_{\pi}<1.3$ and $0<y_{K,p}<0.8$, where positive rapidity is in the deuteron direction, and for transverse momenta $0.1<p_{T}^{\pi,K}<1.0$~GeV/c and $0.3<p_{T}^{p}<1.0$~GeV/c. Within the uncertainties, a lack of centrality dependence is observed in all three ratios. The data are compared to results from other systems and model calculations.
