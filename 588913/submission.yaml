  BNL-RHIC. The ratios of charged  antiparticles to particles have been obtained for pions, kaons, and protons near midrapidity in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 200$~GeV. Ratios of  $\langle \pi^- \rangle / \langle \pi^+ \rangle  =  1.025 \pm 0.006 \mbox{(stat.)} \pm 0.018 \mbox{(syst.)}$, $\langle K^- \rangle/ \langle K^+ \rangle  =  0.95 \pm 0.03 \mbox{(stat.)} \pm 0.03 \mbox{(syst.)}$, and $\langle \bar{p} \rangle / \langle p \rangle  =  0.73 \pm 0.02 \mbox{(stat.)} \pm 0.03 \mbox{(syst.)}$ have been observed. The $\langle K^- \rangle/ \langle K^+ \rangle$ and $\langle \bar{p} \rangle / \langle p \rangle$ ratios are consistent with a baryochemical potential $\mu_B$ of 27~MeV, roughly a factor of 2 smaller than in $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 130$~GeV collisions. The data are compared to results from lower energies and model calculations. Our accurate measurements of the particle ratios impose stringent constraints on current and future models dealing with baryon production and transport.
