comment: |
  The measured pseudorapidity distributions of primary charged particles over a wide pseudorapidity range of $|\\eta|\le 5.4$ and integrated charged particle multiplicities in $d+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200~GeV$ are presented as a function of collision centrality. The longitudinal features of $d+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200~GeV$ are found to be very similar to those seen in $p+A$ collisions at lower energies. The total multiplicity of charged particles is found to scale with the total number of participants according to $N^{d{Au}}_{ch}=\frac{1}{2}\,\langle N_{part}\rangle\,N^{pp}_{ch}$ and the energy dependence of the density of charged particles produced in the fragmentation region exhibits extended longitudinal scaling.
