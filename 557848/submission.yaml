comment: |
  The charged-particle pseudorapidity density $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ has been measured for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=130 GeV at RHIC, using the PHOBOS apparatus.  The total number of charged particles produced for the \% most central Au+Au collisions for $|\eta|\leq$5.4 is found to be 4200$\pm$470.  The evolution of $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ with centrality is discussed, and compared to model calculations and to data from proton-induced collisions. The data show an enhancement in charged-particle production at mid-rapidity, while in the fragmentation regions, the results are consistent with expectations from $pp$ and $pA$ scattering.
