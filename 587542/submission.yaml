comment: |
 This paper describes the measurement of collective flow for charged particles in $\mathrm{Au+Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130\,\mathrm{GeV}$ using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The measured azimuthal hit anisotropy is presented over a wide range of pseudorapidity ($-5.0 < \eta < 5.3$) for the first time at this energy. The result, averaged over momenta and particle species, is observed to reach 7\% for peripheral collisions at midrapidity, falling off with centrality and increasing $|\eta|$. These results call into question the common assumption of longitudinal boost invariance over a large region of rapidity in RHIC collisions.
