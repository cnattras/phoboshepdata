 BNL-RHIC. We have measured transverse momentum distributions of charged hadrons produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\it NN}}} =$ 62.4 GeV. The spectra are presented for transverse momenta $0.25 < p_T < 4.5$~GeV/c, in a pseudo-rapidity range of $0.2 < \eta < 1.4$. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is calculated relative to p+p data at the same collision energy as a function of collision centrality. For $p_T > 2$~GeV/c, $R_{AA}$ is found to be significantly larger than in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\it NN}}} =$ 130 and 200 GeV. In contrast, we find that the evolution of the invariant yields per participant pair from peripheral to central collisions is approximately energy-independent  over this range of collision energies. This observation challenges models of high $p_T$ hadron suppression in terms of parton energy loss.
