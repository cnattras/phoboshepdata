  The PHOBOS experiment has measured the charged particle multiplicityat mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\snn = 200$ GeV as a functionof the collision centrality. Results on $\dndetaone$ divided by the number of participating nucleon pairs $\a venp/2$ are presented as a function of $\avenp$. As was found from similar data at $\snn=130$ GeV, the data can be equally well described by parton saturation models and two-component fits which include contributions that scale as $\np$ and the number of binary collisions $\nc$. We compare the data at the two energies by means of the ratio $\R$ of the charged particle multiplicity for the two different energies as a function of $\avenp$. For events with $\avenp>100$, we find that this ratio is consistent with a constant value of $1.14\pm0.01(stat.)\pm0.05(syst.)$.
