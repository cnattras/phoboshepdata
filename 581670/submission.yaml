comment: |
  The PHOBOS experiment has measured the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~\mathrm{GeV}$ as a function of the collision centrality. Results on $dN_{\mathrm{ch}}/d\eta|_{|\eta|<1}$ divided by the number of participating nucleon pairs $\langle N_{\mathrm{part}} \rangle / 2$ are presented as a function of $\langle N_{\mathrm{part}} \rangle$. As was found from similar data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130~\mathrm{GeV}$, the data can be equally well described by parton saturation models and two-component fits which include contributions that scale with $N_{\mathrm{part}}$ and the number of binary collisions $N_{\mathrm{coll}}$. We compare the data at the two energies by means of the ratio $R_{200/130}$ of the charged particle multiplicity for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130~\mathrm{GeV}$ as a function of $\langle N_{\mathrm{part}} \rangle$. For events with $\langle N_{\mathrm{part}} \rangle > 100$, we find that this ratio is consistent with a constant value of $1.14 \pm 0.01~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.05~\mathrm{(syst.)}$.
