comment: A measurement of two-particle correlations with a high transverse momentum trigger particle ($p_T^{trig} > 2.5$~GeV/c) is presented for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV over the uniquely broad longitudinal acceptance of the PHOBOS detector ($-4 < \Delta\eta < 2$).  A broadening of the away-side azimuthal correlation compared to elementary collisions is observed at all $\Delta\eta$.  As in p+p collisions, the near-side is characterized by a peak of correlated partners at small angle relative to the trigger particle.  However, in central Au+Au collisions an additional correlation extended in $\Delta\eta$ and known as the `ridge' is found to reach at least $|\Delta\eta| \approx 4$.  The ridge yield is largely independent of $\Delta\eta$ over the measured range, and it decreases towards more peripheral collisions.  For the chosen $p_T^{trig}$ cut, the ridge yield is consistent with zero for events with less than roughly 100 participating nucleons.
