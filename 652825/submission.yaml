comment: |
  This paper describes the measurement of the energy dependence of elliptic flow for charged particles in Au+Au collisions using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Data taken at collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} =$ 19.6, 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV are shown over a wide range in pseudorapidity. These results, when plotted as a function of $\eta'=|\eta|-y_{beam}$, scale with approximate linearity throughout $\eta'$, implying no sharp changes in the dynamics of particle production as a function of pseudorapidity or increasing beam energy.
