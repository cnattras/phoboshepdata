  We present transverse momentum distributions of charged hadrons produced in Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$~62.4 and 200~GeV. The spectra are measured for transverse momenta of $0.25 < p_T < 5.0$~GeV/c at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$~62.4 GeV and $0.25 < p_T < 7.0$~GeV/c at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$~200 GeV, in a pseudo-rapidity range of $0.2 < \eta < 1.4$. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is calculated relative to p+p data at both collision energies as a function of collision centrality. At a given collision energy and fractional cross-section, $R_{AA}$ is observed to be systematically larger in Cu+Cu collisions compared to Au+Au. However, for the same number of participating nucleons, $R_{AA}$ is essentially the same in both systems over the measured range of $p_{T}$, in spite of the significantly different geometries of the Cu+Cu and Au+Au systems.
