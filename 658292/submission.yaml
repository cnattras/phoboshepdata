comment: |
 The ratios of the yields of primary charged antiparticles to particles have been obtained for pions, kaons, and protons near midrapidity for p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 200$~GeV. Ratios of $\left<\pi^-/\pi^+\right>=1.000~\pm~0.012$ (stat.) $\pm~0.019$ (syst.), $\left<K^-/K^+\right>=0.93~\pm~0.05$ (stat.) $\pm~0.03$ (syst.), and $\left<\bar{p}/p\right>=0.85~\pm~0.04$ (stat.) $\pm~0.03$ (syst.) have been measured.  The reported values represent the ratio of the yields averaged over the rapidity range of $0.1<y_{\pi}<1.3$ and $0<y_{K,p}<0.8$, and for transverse momenta of $0.1<p_{T}^{\pi,K}<1.0$~GeV/c and $0.3<p_{T}^{p}<1.0$~GeV/c. Within the uncertainties, all three ratios are consistent with the values measured in d+Au collisions at the same energy. The data are compared to results from other collision systems and energies.
